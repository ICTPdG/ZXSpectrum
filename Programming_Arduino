Step 1:
Turning led13 on
"led13On"

Step 2:
Blinking led 13
"Examples>Basics>Blink"

Step 2.1.:
Blinking led 13 a defined number of times (1+1+1+10 seconds)
"BlinkingIntervals"

Step 3:
Turning on and off led13 by crossing 2 wires (pin2 GND (10K resistor))
"Examples>Digital>Button"

Step 4:
Listening # of button pushes (shine LED13) and write it on serial PORT
"ButtonPushCounter_A"

Step 5:
Listening # of button pushes (shine LED13) and repeats blinking of LED13

Step 5.1.:
5 by delay time

Step 5.2.:
5 by "Enter" pin

Step 6:
Enter two # by button pushes and blinking addition on LED13

Step 7:
Technical solutions for INPUT and OUTPUT + programming (1 figure...)
